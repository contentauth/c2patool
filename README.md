# c2patool HAS MOVED

`c2patool` is a command line tool for working with C2PA [manifests](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_manifests) and media assets (audio, image or video files).

As of 10 December 2024, we've transitioned work on the c2patool project to the [contentauth/c2pa-rs](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/blob/main/cli) repo.

We have moved all existing open PRs and issues to the c2pa-rs repo. If you have _new_ issues or PRs, please file them in the c2pa-rs repo.
